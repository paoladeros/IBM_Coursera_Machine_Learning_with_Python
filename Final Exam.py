# Which statement is NOT TRUE about k-means clustering?
# 
# 
# * k-means divides the data into non-overlapping clusters without any cluster-internal structure.
# 
# 
# * As k-means is an iterative algorithm, it guarantees that it will always converge to the global optimum. 
# 
# 
# * The objective of k-means, is to form clusters in such a way that similar samples go into a cluster, and dissimilar samples fall into different clusters. 

# Correct: 
# As k-means is an iterative algorithm, it guarantees that it will always converge to the global optimum.
